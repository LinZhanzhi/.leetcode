Instructions:

- When generating or editing a solution for a LeetCode problem, do NOT remove or change any existing formatting, header comment, or footer comment in the file. These comments provide metadata needed by extensions to submit or grade the code and must remain untouched.
- Generate the solution code immediately below the existing comments and formatting, where appropriate.
- Before the code, always output the following two educational explanation sections, in this order:
    1. A *brief, digested understanding* of the LeetCode problem in your own words, focusing on the core concepts and what transformation or decision the code is making. Do not simply rephrase the problem description; instead, express your own understanding so a beginner can grasp the goal and constraints.
    2. A *high-level summary* describing the overall solution approach, the main algorithmic assumptions, and the expected time and space complexity.
- After these two sections, output the solution code.
- Within the code, add *detailed, educational inline comments* explaining each step, variable, and function. Each comment should clarify not just what the code does, but why it is done that way, including algorithm choices, optimizations, edge-case handling, and implementation decisions.
- Ensure all comments and explanations are sufficiently detailed for a beginner to learn both the algorithm and the solution logic.
- If the code is in a specific language (e.g., Python, Java, C++), make explanations suitable for someone new to that language.
- Never modify, remove, or overwrite any comment blocks or formatting at the top or bottom of the file.
- Do not output the raw LeetCode problem description. Focus on clear understanding and teaching.
- 
- refer to this preferable example file.

 * [208] Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)
 */

/*
 * High-Level Summary:
 * -------------------
 * This implementation provides a Trie (also known as a prefix tree), which is a
 * tree-like data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a
 * dataset of strings. Each node in the Trie represents a single character of a
 * word. The main operations supported are:
 *   - insert(word): Add a word to the Trie.
 *   - search(word): Check if a word exists in the Trie.
 *   - startsWith(prefix): Check if any word in the Trie starts with the given
 * prefix.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - All input words consist of lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z') only.
 *   - The Trie is case-sensitive and does not handle uppercase or
 * non-alphabetic characters.
 *
 * Algorithm Choice:
 *   - We use an array of 26 pointers for each node to represent the 26
 * lowercase English letters.
 *   - This allows O(1) access to each child node, making operations fast.
 *   - The Trie is implemented as a class with a nested TrieNode struct for
 * clarity and encapsulation.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 *   - insert(word): O(L), where L is the length of the word.
 *   - search(word): O(L), where L is the length of the word.
 *   - startsWith(prefix): O(P), where P is the length of the prefix.
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 *   - O(N * M), where N is the number of words inserted and M is the average
 * length of the words, since each unique prefix creates new nodes.

        return false;
      node = node->children[idx];
    }
    // After traversing all characters, check if this node marks the end of a
    // word. This is important because a prefix may exist, but not the full
    // word.

  // Checks if there is any word in the Trie that starts with the given prefix.
  // Returns true if such a prefix exists, false otherwise.

    // Traverse the Trie following the path of the prefix.
    for (char c : prefix) {

      if (!node->children[idx])
        return false;
      node = node->children[idx];
    }
    // If we successfully traverse the prefix, it means at least one word with
    // this prefix exists.

/**
 * Example usage:
 * --------------
 * Trie* obj = new Trie();
 * obj->insert(word);           // Inserts 'word' into the Trie.
 * bool param_2 = obj->search(word);      // Returns true if 'word' exists in
 * the Trie. bool param_3 = obj->startsWith(prefix); // Returns true if any word
 * starts with 'prefix'.
 *
 * Edge Cases:
 * -----------
 * - Inserting or searching for an empty string will mark or check the root
 * node's isEnd flag.
 * - The implementation assumes all input consists of lowercase English letters
 * only.
 * - If a word is a prefix of another word (e.g., "app" and "apple"), both can
 * coexist in the Trie.
