Certainly! Here is a detailed, step-by-step mathematical proof that the number of structurally unique binary search trees (BSTs) that can be formed with values 1, 2, ..., n is given by the nth Catalan number:

## 1. Definition of the Problem

Let $G(n)$ denote the number of structurally unique BSTs that can be formed from $n$ distinct values (1, 2, ..., n).

We want to prove that:
$$
G(n) = C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!}
$$

## 2. Recursive Structure of BSTs

- Every BST with n nodes has a root.
- Say the value of the root is $i$ (where $1 \leq i \leq n$).
- The left subtree contains values $1, 2, ..., i-1$.
- The right subtree contains values $i+1, ..., n$.
- The number of unique BSTs with $n$ nodes, rooted at $i$, is the product of:
  - The number of BSTs that can be formed with the left subtree ($i-1$ nodes): $G(i-1)$
  - The number of BSTs that can be formed with the right subtree ($n-i$ nodes): $G(n-i)$

Thus, the total number of unique BSTs with $n$ nodes is
$$
G(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} G(i-1) \cdot G(n-i)
$$

## 3. Initial Condition

For $n = 0$ (empty tree), there is one BST (the empty tree itself):
$$
G(0) = 1
$$

## 4. This Recursion is the Catalan Recursion

The recursion
$$
G(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} G(i-1) \cdot G(n-i)
$$
is identical to the recurrence of the Catalan numbers:
$$
C_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n-1-k}, \qquad C_0 = 1
$$

**Index Shift**: Replace $i-1$ with $k$ (so $k = 0, 1, ..., n-1$), and the sum matches.

## 5. Explicit Formula for Catalan Numbers

The solution to the Catalan recurrence is the closed form:
$$
C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!}
$$

## 6. Conclusion

Therefore, the number of structurally unique BSTs with nodes labeled $1, ..., n$ is $C_n$:

$$
G(n) = C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}
$$

## 7. Example Calculation

For $n = 3$:
$$
C_3 = \frac{1}{4} \binom{6}{3} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
$$
So, there are 5 unique BSTs for $n = 3$.

**Summary of the proof**:  
- The recursion for unique BSTs with $n$ nodes matches exactly the Catalan number recurrence.
- With the same base case ($G(0) = 1$), the solution is the closed formula for Catalan numbers.
- Thus, the answer is proved.
