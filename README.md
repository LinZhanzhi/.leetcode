# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. I use this to practice algorithms, data structures, and SQL.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the problem number range to keep the root directory clean and manageable.

- **1-200**: Problems 1 to 200
- **201-400**: Problems 201 to 400
- **401-600**: Problems 401 to 600
- ... and so on.

## Languages

Most solutions are implemented in **C++**, but you may also find solutions in:
- SQL
- Shell Script
- C#

## Disclaimer

These solutions are for educational purposes and personal practice. They might not always be the most optimal solution, but I strive to make them clean and understandable.
